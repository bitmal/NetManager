[x] 0) make sure telnet is enabled on router (would prefer ssh, but not a feature in current router firmware)
- telnet is LAN only on current firmware
- telnet protocol is raw text, so use with caution... do not expose to WAN

1) detect wifi connection
	- swap to other band on disconnect

[~] 2) access router using telnet library
	[x] restart router
		-> works, but need to refactor

3) swap back to 2.4 ghz band when available

4) add in a simple command system for changing settings
-> ie. current login and password, frequency of wifi state query

5) elaborate as a background program
